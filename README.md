# Titanic-logistic-regression
This project predicts survival on the Titanic using machine learning, specifically **Logistic Regression**. The dataset is the classic Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

# Project Goals

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Apply logistic regression for binary classification.
- Evaluate model using confusion matrix and classification metrics.
- Visualize results for better understanding.

  # ML Model

- **Logistic Regression** using `sklearn`
- Train/test split: 80/20
- Evaluation:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1 Score
  - Confusion Matrix
 
  # Results

- Achieved around ~78% accuracy
- Model performs well on classifying survivors vs. non-survivors
- Future improvements: try Decision Trees, Random Forests, and hyperparameter tuning
